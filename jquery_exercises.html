<h1>Hey, it’s Hannah. Hannah Baker. Don’t adjust your… whatever device you’re hearing this on. It's me, live and in stereo. No return engagements, no encore, and this time, absolutely no requests. Get a snack. Settle in. Because I'm about to tell you the story of my life. More specifically, why my life ended. And if you're listening to this tape you're one of the reasons why. I'm not saying which tape brings you into the story. But fear not, if you received this lovely little box, your name will pop up. I promise.

    <h3>Hey pay attention...</h3>
    <p>This is an important list of all the people who caused me to make my decision...</p>

<p>“Because when you’re posed, you know someone’s watching.  You put on your very best smile.  You let your sweetest personality shine.  And in high school people are always watching so there’s always a reason to pose.” - Hannah Baker</p>
